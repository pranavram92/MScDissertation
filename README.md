Created an Open-Banking Financial Application for my MSc Dissertation .

Open Banking is a system that allows access to financial data through third-party applications. It is the framework which allows combining multiple bank accounts in a single application. Due to this, creative and innovative applications have been developed to achieve multiple objectives which includes improved financial decision making, expanded payment choice, increased access to financial advice and guidance etc.

The front-end of the application is created using ReactJS. NodeJS is used for back-end. NoSQL MongoDB is used for storing user data. The financial data is acquired using Plaid API, which facilitates the connection of multiple bank accounts in one place. Due to the lack of desired infrastructure for security reasons, the plaid sandbox API is used, where all the financial data involved are dummy.

Features:
1. View all accounts' balance in one screen. (Example: Savings Account, Current Account, Credit Card Account etc)
2. View transactions for each account with pagination to improve user experience.
3. Make a dummy transaction from one account to another.
4. Visualise credit card transactions using charts. (Pie, Column, Donut etc)
5. View important transactions on a calendar based view.

Have a look at my code and let me know what you think. Cheers.
